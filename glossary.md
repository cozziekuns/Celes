## Glossary

Mahjong is a game where it is often much easier to express certain ideas by using Japanese terms. 
Since I understand that not all of those reading will be familiar with the Japanese terminology, 
I've provided a glossary of the most important terms you should know to be able to read along.

### Elementary

I assume that everyone knows these terms, but players that only play with English terms may not. 
The absolute basics (e.g. calls) have been excluded for brevity.
