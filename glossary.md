Glossary of Mahjong Terms:

### Elementary

These are Japanese terms that you absolutely must know in order to play Mahjong. I assume that 
everyone knows these terms, but players that only play with English terms may not. The absolute 
basics (e.g. calls) have been excluded for brevity.

#### Tiles

Manzu（萬子、マンズ）- The Character tiles. In this blog, X manzu will be denoted as Xm (e.g. 3m).
Pinzu（筒子、ピンズ）- The Dot tiles. In this blog, X pinzu will be denoted as Xm (e.g. 3p).
Souzu（索子、ソーズ） - The Bamboo tiles. In this blog, X souzu will be denoted as Xs (e.g. 3s).

shanpon waiting on 24p.

#### Abortive Draws

Ryuukyoku（流局）- Abortive draw that occurs when the round ends without an agari.

distinct terminals and honor tiles. Will occasionally be shortened to 9s9h.

honba usually increases the worth of the next hand by 300 points.
