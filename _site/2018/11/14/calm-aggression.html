  <p>Last weekend, I participated in the Pacific Mahjong League Riichi Mahjong Open in San Francisco. 
After a strong start, I ended up placing rather disappointingly, missing my goal of making the 
semi-finals (top 8 advance). While I can chalk up some of my poor play to my inexperience with the 
particular ruleset (WRC, which has no aka-dora and relatively low +15/+5/-5/-15 uma), a surprising 
amount of crucial mistakes that I made throughout the tournament were in regards to simple 
push-fold decisions.</p>

<p>Although I’m not sure how much it shows in my demeanour, I am in general a very extreme person. 
When I’m confident, my entire body is brimming with confidence and I feel as if I can outplay every 
micro-situtation. When I’m nervous, I become unable to accurately assess situations, erring either 
towards extreme aggression or extremely passivity. My play also becomes a lot more obvious and 
oversimplified. This left me bleeding points that I shouldn’t have bled, and missing out on points 
that I should’ve won. In order to correct this weakness, I took a trip into a world far-removed 
from mahjong; the world of shogi.</p>

<p>Shogi is a board game that, while I rarely play and am far from proficient in, has struck a chord 
with me ever since reading the manga “March Comes In Like a Lion.” As opposed to chess, where 
material advantage is much more pronounced, shogi is a game that emphasises speed, momentum, and 
initiative. It is not rare for shogi players to sacrifice key pieces like the bishop or the rook, 
if it will give them momentum for their upcoming attack. The ease at which the initiatve can swing 
in shogi makes planning ahead all the more important; a violent attack may seem winning, but if 
that attack is exhausted, it is a simple exercise for the opponent to seize the initiative and 
mount a counterattack.</p>

<p>The most influential player in the history of modern shogi, Yoshiharu Habu, plays with a very calm 
and tempered aggression. When a threat is being posed to his camp, rarely does he panic and rush 
for a defense. Nor does he brazenly commiting to his own attack, only to realise later that he did 
not have the necessary resources. Instead, he will often correctly identify that he has the time to 
make quiet, calculated in-between moves. He uses these in-between moves to eek out the smallest of 
advantages in preparation for breaching the opponent’s castle. Many of his most amazing moves are 
calm in-between moves he uses to gain a positional advantage, or to capture that one extra piece 
necessary for his attack. Rarely does a pre-medidated attack that Habu commits to fail. This 
ability to calmly scrap for small advantages admist the chaos of the shogi board is his biggest 
strength. This is also a strength that can be emulated on the mahjong table.</p>

<p>While the parallels may be hard to see at first, mahjong is, much like shogi, a game of moments and 
momentum. Unfortunately for mahjong players, we are not afforded the same freedoms that shogi 
players are given. In mahjong, initiatves are both seized and stolen by coincidence. However, the 
same general concepts still apply; if we end up over-commiting ourselves to a violent attack, we 
may end up losing the initiative and find ourselves faced with a counterattack. Whenever we call 
riichi, we are commiting wholeheartedly to their attack for that entire round. So it is imperative 
we calmly assess the situation beforehand, instead of making an awkward realisation after the 
fact.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/5-1.png" alt="5-1" /></p>

<p>This is one such example where calling riichi is simply over-aggressive. In most situations, taking 
the micro-initiative with a dealer riichi should be a no-brain play, but this is a rather 
unusual scenario where a riichi doesn’t afford us much in terms of gain. Riichi is often an 
unusually strong yaku with many advantages and few demerits, but in this situation, the demerits 
are much more pronounced. Furthermore, any advantages that calling riichi gives us are effectively 
“win-more.”</p>

<p>I will not deny that tsumoing a dealer mangan in this situation would be decisive, but how much 
different would it be from tsumoing our hand damaten? In both cases, after the tsumo there is a 
10000 point gap or higher between all other players on the table. The extra points from the mangan 
tsumo would akin to taking a 90% chance of 1st place, and turning it into a 95% chance of achieving 
1st place. The diminished rewards of the mangan tsumo are not worth the cost of calling riichi.</p>

<p>An argument can be made for the extra points from ron, but expecting the 58s to come out of your 
opponents’s hand post riichi with this board state and 5s dora is, quite simply, understimating 
your opponents. If anything, if we are aiming for a ron then we should stay dama.</p>

<p>As for demerits, riichi risks alienating our biggest friend on the board: toimen. Toimen is the one 
player on the board that is desperately fighting to scrap for any points possible, since even 2000 
points would put them in mangan tsumo range of simocha in all-last. Toimen winning the hand is 
also one of our the best case scenarios. A decent sized win from toimen would put extra pressure 
onto simocha, who would be third place going into all-last. With a very real threat of 4th place, 
simocha no longer has the freedom to make big hands on their oya all-last.</p>

<p>So we are fine with toimen winning the hand, provided they do not win off of us. If we do call 
riichi, toimen will be incentivised to fight against us if they are anywhere near tenpai. And if 
things do end up going south, since we see no dora we could find ourselves paying into a mangan 
hand to someone we didn’t actually need to fight. Play nice, and don’t break your friends’ trust.</p>

<p>In fact, if any of toimen, kamicha or simocha win the hand, we’ll still most likely be going into 
all-last with a comfortable lead, <strong>so long as they don’t win off of us</strong>. Even if kamicha wins 
their hand, it’s most likely a 3-han 30-fu hand, and we’ll head into all-last as temporary top. The 
case where everyone except us are tenpai is essentially equivalent to this. If we end up calling 
riichi, we’ll be in an awkward situation where our dora-less hand is fighting against hands that we 
don’t need to fight.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/5-2.png" alt="5-2" /></p>

<p>In this actual game, I decided (perhaps too aggresively) to push up to the 8p while staying dama. 
I then calmly folded after drawing 6p. The risk of pressing for an agari at this point of the game 
is not worth the potential reward. Again, even if I end the hand as the only person noten, going 
into all-last with a temporary top is still a comfortable enough situation to play given the 
minimal risk necessary to get there. This round ended up going to ryuukyoku, and I ended up taking 
1st in all-last after toimen tsumo’d a hand (which was unfortunately not enough to get them into 
3rd, since they did not flip uradora).</p>

<p>Before committing to an attack, make sure to consider the state of the board, and forge a path with 
that information in mind. The scariest players are the ones that are capable of camly assessing the 
situation and making quiet steps forward. no matter what amount of duress they are under. Make a 
calm assessment of the situation and utilise that information to correctly choose your battles. 
I honestly don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that a master of this skill alone could become, 
as Habu has in Shogi, the best in the world.</p>

<p><strong>See you on Tenhou.</strong></p>
