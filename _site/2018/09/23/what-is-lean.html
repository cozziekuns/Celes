  <p>Lean is not a quick hack to increase your win-rates. In the words of Bobby Scar, who applied a 
<a href="https://leanmelee.wordpress.com/">similar-but-different Lean framework</a> (that inspired this one) 
to the game Super Smash Brothers Melee:</p>

<p><em>First, Lean is not a way to start winning a few more games quickly. It’s also not 
merely a reminder that we should continue to learn and improve. The desire to improve 
is a requirement. A commitment to the philosophy of continuously achieving validated 
learning is the foundation.</em></p>

<p>Lean Mahjong is a framework that is all about identifying and removing waste from our process. To 
do this requires a strong understanding of mahjong fundamentals and mechanisms that I plan to delve 
into in the upcoming posts. Instead of giving a detailed explanation and a bunch of definitions 
about what Lean is though, I figure the best way to explain what I hope to accomplish is with a 
simple example. For now, here’s a little taste of what I have planned.</p>

<h3 id="a-problem">A Problem</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2-1.png" alt="2-1" /></p>

<p>What is the best tile to cut here? The xia screams saftey; after all, toimen has already cut a xia, 
meaning that anyone waiting on that tile would have to have committed themselves to a tanki xia 
wait. Plus, if the xia does pass as expected, and one of the two players in riichi is unlucky 
enough to draw a haku, this gives us an instant ryanmen tenpai for a dealer mangan, which would 
essentially be a win condition given how far behind kamicha is. With all that said, surely xia is 
the best tile to cut here?</p>

<p>That’s exactly the trap that I fell in admist the chaos of this hanchan. As a result, I ended up 
playing into a baiman from kamicha (chiitoi with 2 dora 2 ura), and ended the hanchan in 4th, 
losing precious Tenhou dan points. Was this really my fault, or did I just get screwed over by the 
gods of mahjong yet again?</p>

<h3 id="assessment">Assessment</h3>

<p>Was cutting xia such a grave sin? While there are many good reasons that you should cut xia here, 
that doesn’t necessarily mean that you should. Even if it is the most EV positive tile to cut here, 
it’s also what I consider a “lazy” cut.</p>

<p>There are a few key points here. The first is the fact that kamicha is below 3900 points. If they 
play into anything bigger than a 3 han 30 fu hand, they will bust. Assuming that kamicha and 
simocha are waiting on a similar number of tiles, and that both me and toimen fold, and that one of
the ronpai is drawn by a combatant, we are left with the following three outcomes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>50% chance that either player tsumos.</li>
  <li>25% chance that kamicha plays into simocha.</li>
  <li>25% chance that simocha plays into kamicha.</li>
</ol>

<p>(Note: I’ve purposely ignored ryuukyoku since it is actually beneficial in this case. Getting off 
your dealership in South round as 1st place, without incuring any point differential from your 
rival toimen should be considered a win. The percentages are all slightly lower when you factor 
in ryuukyoku.)</p>

<p>This means that by doing absolutely nothing, my chance of flat out winning the hanchan is already 
around a solid 25%; extremely good considering that I am playing betaori. Usually when you decide 
to play betaori, you are essentially conceding a bite-sized chunk of points (tenpai payments or 
tsumo, plus the points you may have earned had you pushed) to dodge a large hit. In this case, you 
might not even have to take a small hit; kamicha busting would be to your absolute advantage!</p>

<p>Similarly, in the event that kamicha hits simocha, kamicha and simocha would now both be outside of 
striking range of first. Essentially, they would be scrapping between themselves for 3rd, and the 
battle for first would be narrowed down to a battle between me and toimen. This is especially good 
in Houou, as placing 2nd nets a fairly decent reward of +45pt.</p>

<p>The second key point is that the dora is the haku. Since I’m already holding two of them, if any of 
the two combatants is using the dora, it must either be a dora tanki or dora toitsu. The first 
thing this tells us is that at least one of the hands is likely cheap, since there are only 2 
usable dora left. The threat of paying into a large oya penalty is therefore lessened.</p>

<p>Next, let’s consider how this affects the potential hand shapes of the players in riichi. 
Discounting dora tanki (since there’s no way I’m playing the dora), let’s suppose that someone is 
holding the dora toitsu. Naturally, a menzen hand holding a toitsu of yakuhai tiles lends itself to 
a specific hand: chiitoi. If we consider the possibility of chiitoi, xia immediately becomes much 
more dangerous. Not only is it commonly considered a good chiitoi wait, if we do play in with the 
xia, it is extremely likely that we will be paying into a haneman. Even that alone is enough to 
offset the relative safety that the xia brings in terms of deal-in percentage. Chancing it risks 
too much for next to zero value.</p>

<h3 id="alternative">Alternative</h3>

<p>So, what should we discard instead? Is there a better tile to cut? In this case, even taking 
toimen’s xia discard into consideration, there is a safer tile to cut.</p>

<p><strong>8s is the safest cut in this instance.</strong></p>

<p>Kamicha has cut 8s and the tile that they declared riichi on was the 5s. This means that if simocha 
is waiting on the 8s, it would have to be kanchan, shanpon, or tanki.</p>

<p>We see two 8s tiles in the discard pile and we have one 8s in our hand, so a shanpon wait is 
physically impossible. Simocha discarded 6s two turns before the riichi, which means that they 
would’ve had to have purposely given up a 58s ryanmen for an 8s kanchan. Last but not least, if 
simocha is waiting on a 8s tanki, that means that they purposely commited to a jigoku tanki on the 
8s, knowing fully well that kamicha is likely to chase given their desperate situation. From a 
macro-game perspective, this train of thought makes next to no sense.</p>

<h3 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h3>

<p>Understanding that we made a mistake is important. But even more important is uncovering the root 
cause; that is, why did we make this mistake in the first place? To diagnose this, we have to be 
honest with ourselves and determine, from deep within our mental stack, what exactly led to us 
making this mistake. In our reflection, we need to scan for root causes, which are usually quite 
hard to surface. In my experience, working your way back through your thought process is generally 
the best way to filter for these root causes. For reference, my own inner dialgoue went a little 
like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I cut the xia and dealt into a baiman hand.
    <ul>
      <li>Why did I cut the xia?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I felt like xia was safe to push, and I wasn’t aware of any alternatives.
    <ul>
      <li>Why did I feel like xia was safe? Why wasn’t I aware of 8s?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I made a lazy play and didn’t bother considering 8s, because xia is usually safe. I also failed 
to consider that, if xia is the ronpai, it is very likely that I play into a haneman.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, the root cause of the problem was hidden in the third layer of my thought process. I 
was lazy; even though xia isn’t genbutsu, I naturally assumed it was the safest tile, given that 
the rest of my hand is filled with all number tiles and the dora. It felt even safer because I had 
a toitsu in my hand, and toimen had discarded one early, leaving tanki as the only option. Had I 
stopped to think about how dangerous (value wise) xia is from the context of this board, or noticed 
that 8s was practically a 100% safe tile, I would have never played it.</p>

<p>(As an aside, I personally believe that the “EV-positive” play is almost always also the lazy one. 
Lazy doesn’t mean that the play is necessarily bad; it just means that, for a given board state, 
there may be a better cut lingering in the shadows that we miss by tunneling on the EV-positive 
play. I often wonder if people that play different imperfect information games, like poker, carry 
similar thoughts to the ones I do regarding this matter…)</p>

<h3 id="treatment">Treatment</h3>

<p>Now that we have identified a root cause for the waste, we need to determine some sort of practical 
treatment to ensure that we never make the same mistake again. In this case, the root cause of my 
misplay was due to my laziness; I tunnel visionned on a tile that is usually safe, and discounted 
any information that might have suggested a better cut.</p>

<p>In the past, I’ve tried increasing my in-game focus level with varying results. It’s simply 
unrealistic to believe that your mind will always be in the zone, especially when playing in a 
relatively low pressure environment like Tenhou. With that in mind, my proposed treatment is a 
quick and fast rule that I can apply and eventually make a habit of. The goal is that, when faced 
with a similar situation, my mind will naturally follows this process. My proposed treatment is as 
follows:</p>

<p><em>Whenever riichi is called, immediately look for at least two tiles that are safe. Then, if 
folding, compare those options and cut the one you have concluded is safest.</em></p>

<p>While I haven’t tested this approach yet (to be honest, I just came up with it today), it seems a 
lot more promising than the usual approach of going down the tile safety tier list. With this, I am 
essentially playing a mind trick on myself. This mind trick forces me to validate the actual safety 
level of a certain tile in lieu of other potential safe tiles.</p>

<p>Obviously, this approach can backfire; the last thing you want to do is waste time stuck in 
analysis paralysis while the Tenhou clock keeps ticking down. It also uses a lot more mental energy 
than the usual “throw the safest tile”. But as this approach becomes more habitual, I am hoping 
that the benefits will provide more than enough compensation for its downsides.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>I hope this gives you a deeper insight on what the goal of this project is. Remember, a huge part 
of eliminating waste comes from treating lazy habits like this one. During the course of this 
voyage, I aim to reason about and eliminate as much waste from my mahjong process as I can, keeping 
it as lean as possible. Hopefully you have been inspired to do the same.</p>

<p><strong>See you on Tenhou.</strong></p>
