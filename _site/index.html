      <div class="post">
        <p>Last weekend, I participated in the Pacific Mahjong League Riichi Mahjong Open in San Francisco. 
After a strong start, I ended up placing rather disappointingly, missing my goal of making the 
semi-finals (top 8 advance). While I can chalk up some of my poor play to my inexperience with the 
particular ruleset (WRC, which has no aka-dora and relatively low +15/+5/-5/-15 uma), a surprising 
amount of crucial mistakes that I made throughout the tournament were in regards to simple 
push-fold decisions.</p>

<p>Although I’m not sure how much it shows in my demeanour, I am in general a very extreme person. 
When I’m confident, my entire body is brimming with confidence and I feel as if I can outplay every 
micro-situtation. When I’m nervous, I become unable to accurately assess situations, erring either 
towards extreme aggression or extremely passivity. My play also becomes a lot more obvious and 
oversimplified. This left me bleeding points that I shouldn’t have bled, and missing out on points 
that I should’ve won. In order to correct this weakness, I took a trip into a world far-removed 
from mahjong; the world of shogi.</p>

<p>Shogi is a board game that, while I rarely play and am far from proficient in, has struck a chord 
with me ever since reading the manga “March Comes In Like a Lion.” As opposed to chess, where 
material advantage is much more pronounced, shogi is a game that emphasises speed, momentum, and 
initiative. It is not rare for shogi players to sacrifice key pieces like the bishop or the rook, 
if it will give them momentum for their upcoming attack. The ease at which the initiatve can swing 
in shogi makes planning ahead all the more important; a violent attack may seem winning, but if 
that attack is exhausted, it is a simple exercise for the opponent to seize the initiative and 
mount a counterattack.</p>

<p>The most influential player in the history of modern shogi, Yoshiharu Habu, plays with a very calm 
and tempered aggression. When a threat is being posed to his camp, rarely does he panic and rush 
for a defense. Nor does he brazenly commiting to his own attack, only to realise later that he did 
not have the necessary resources. Instead, he will often correctly identify that he has the time to 
make quiet, calculated in-between moves. He uses these in-between moves to eek out the smallest of 
advantages in preparation for breaching the opponent’s castle. Many of his most amazing moves are 
calm in-between moves he uses to gain a positional advantage, or to capture that one extra piece 
necessary for his attack. Rarely does a pre-medidated attack that Habu commits to fail. This 
ability to calmly scrap for small advantages admist the chaos of the shogi board is his biggest 
strength. This is also a strength that can be emulated on the mahjong table.</p>

<p>While the parallels may be hard to see at first, mahjong is, much like shogi, a game of moments and 
momentum. Unfortunately for mahjong players, we are not afforded the same freedoms that shogi 
players are given. In mahjong, initiatves are both seized and stolen by coincidence. However, the 
same general concepts still apply; if we end up over-commiting ourselves to a violent attack, we 
may end up losing the initiative and find ourselves faced with a counterattack. Whenever we call 
riichi, we are commiting wholeheartedly to their attack for that entire round. So it is imperative 
we calmly assess the situation beforehand, instead of making an awkward realisation after the 
fact.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/5-1.png" alt="5-1" /></p>

<p>This is one such example where calling riichi is simply over-aggressive. In most situations, taking 
the micro-initiative with a dealer riichi should be a no-brain play, but this is a rather 
unusual scenario where a riichi doesn’t afford us much in terms of gain. Riichi is often an 
unusually strong yaku with many advantages and few demerits, but in this situation, the demerits 
are much more pronounced. Furthermore, any advantages that calling riichi gives us are effectively 
“win-more.”</p>

<p>I will not deny that tsumoing a dealer mangan in this situation would be decisive, but how much 
different would it be from tsumoing our hand damaten? In both cases, after the tsumo there is a 
10000 point gap or higher between all other players on the table. The extra points from the mangan 
tsumo would akin to taking a 90% chance of 1st place, and turning it into a 95% chance of achieving 
1st place. The diminished rewards of the mangan tsumo are not worth the cost of calling riichi.</p>

<p>An argument can be made for the extra points from ron, but expecting the 58s to come out of your 
opponents’s hand post riichi with this board state and 5s dora is, quite simply, understimating 
your opponents. If anything, if we are aiming for a ron then we should stay dama.</p>

<p>As for demerits, riichi risks alienating our biggest friend on the board: toimen. Toimen is the one 
player on the board that is desperately fighting to scrap for any points possible, since even 2000 
points would put them in mangan tsumo range of simocha in all-last. Toimen winning the hand is 
also one of our the best case scenarios. A decent sized win from toimen would put extra pressure 
onto simocha, who would be third place going into all-last. With a very real threat of 4th place, 
simocha no longer has the freedom to make big hands on their oya all-last.</p>

<p>So we are fine with toimen winning the hand, provided they do not win off of us. If we do call 
riichi, toimen will be incentivised to fight against us if they are anywhere near tenpai. And if 
things do end up going south, since we see no dora we could find ourselves paying into a mangan 
hand to someone we didn’t actually need to fight. Play nice, and don’t break your friends’ trust.</p>

<p>In fact, if any of toimen, kamicha or simocha win the hand, we’ll still most likely be going into 
all-last with a comfortable lead, <strong>so long as they don’t win off of us</strong>. Even if kamicha wins 
their hand, it’s most likely a 3-han 30-fu hand, and we’ll head into all-last as temporary top. The 
case where everyone except us are tenpai is essentially equivalent to this. If we end up calling 
riichi, we’ll be in an awkward situation where our dora-less hand is fighting against hands that we 
don’t need to fight.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/5-2.png" alt="5-2" /></p>

<p>In this actual game, I decided (perhaps too aggresively) to push up to the 8p while staying dama. 
I then calmly folded after drawing 6p. The risk of pressing for an agari at this point of the game 
is not worth the potential reward. Again, even if I end the hand as the only person noten, going 
into all-last with a temporary top is still a comfortable enough situation to play given the 
minimal risk necessary to get there. This round ended up going to ryuukyoku, and I ended up taking 
1st in all-last after toimen tsumo’d a hand (which was unfortunately not enough to get them into 
3rd, since they did not flip uradora).</p>

<p>Before committing to an attack, make sure to consider the state of the board, and forge a path with 
that information in mind. The scariest players are the ones that are capable of camly assessing the 
situation and making quiet steps forward. no matter what amount of duress they are under. Make a 
calm assessment of the situation and utilise that information to correctly choose your battles. 
I honestly don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that a master of this skill alone could become, 
as Habu has in Shogi, the best in the world.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Anyone can play solitaire.</em></strong></p>

<p>A friend of mine once posited that they could make a strong mahjong bot simply by running a 
machine-learning model tuned towards maximising agari-rate. This is akin to saying that a strong 
chess bot can be made by tuning for capturing material. Fortunately for us humans, mahjong, like 
chess, is not such a simple game. Mahjong is not just about winning hands, just as chess is not 
just about winning material. After all, anyone can play solitaire. What mahjong really is about is 
<em>winning games</em>.</p>

<p>So how can we optimise for winning games? Like in life, trying to go it alone is a bad idea; the 
best way to win is often to <em>find a friend</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/4-1.png" alt="4-1" /></p>

<p>What should we discard here? Currently, we’re in ORAS with a decently comfortable lead over 3rd 
and 4th place. Since a mangan direct from either 3rd or 4th would lead us in 3rd place, the 
standard line would be to aim for 1st place. Unfortunately for us, 1st place is more than 
a haneman tsumo away from us; in order to even think about taking 1st place, we’d need to form what 
is at least a haneman class hand. We do have a nice aka-dora and the dora 4s can connect to an 
aka 5s, so a haneman isn’t that unrealistic… But even after all that, we would have to flip some 
ura dora on the tsumo for the baiman, or pray that 1st place plays into us. Not happening.</p>

<p>Aiming for 1st place here is not only unrealistic, it puts us in danager of falling into 3rd. While 
we do have a comfortable lead over 3rd and 4th, that lead is rather fickle; a mangan tsumo from 
either player will put us into 3rd, and we would end up losing a precious +45 dan points that 
should’ve been all but secured. Worse, if we flying too close to the sky and riiching, we 
might end up with some burnt wings if we play into a mangan from 4th place; now we’ve just ended up 
in last place from the riichi stick payment.</p>

<p>So the goal of this hand should be to secure 2nd place. There are actually a few ways we can 
accomplish this. The first, and most straightforward method, would be to of course win a hand. 
While two turns in it does look like our hand is pretty fast, this is one of those hands where 
it’ll be hard to secure a yaku that isn’t riichi. Pinfu is probably the closest candidate, to a 
yaku that we can use, but it’s just as likely that we’ll end up completing our ryanmen before our 
bad waits, and be stuck with a hand we need to riichi in order to win. Given that this is an ORAS 
situation where the speed of our hand is all that matters, we would really like to be able to call; 
something that we obviously can’t do with pinfu as our yaku.</p>

<p>We have the choice to rely on our kamicha. It goes without saying, but if kamicha wins any hand, 
the game will end and we’ll end up in second. Unfortunately, this isn’t the most reliable strategy 
either. Not only is kamicha in a situation where they’re incentivised to fold (as they are last oya 
with an obscene lead), even if they did have a quick hand, the only way we could assist them would 
be by blocking off our simocha from calling. This leaves us at the mercy of toimen; if toimen 
riichis and tsumos a mangan, bye-bye 2nd place.</p>

<p>Which brings us to my favourite method; feed simocha! We can leverage the fact that simocha must 
favour speed over value given the amount of duress he is under from toimen. Not only is toimen 
within 2000 points of simocha, his first and second discards (8m -&gt; hatsu tedashi) signal a quicker 
than usual hand. Furthermore, since this is aka-ari mahjong, toimen’s condition of escaping 3rd 
(2000 points) is essentially a given, with how easy it is to use the 4s dora and the existence of 
aka-dora. If we are able to convince simocha to start calling, we can reduce the average/maxmimum 
value of their hand and thereby reduce the chance that we’ll fall into 3rd place via a mangan 
tsumo.</p>

<p>Due t the board situation and how irregular simocha’s discards are, we can already deduce a myriad 
of conclusions about their hand. Simocha’s first and second drop were both a 9p from inside of their 
hand; in other words, they explicitly dropped a toitsu of routouhai from the very start. From this, 
we can conclude that they are almost surely going for a tanyao hand. If they were going for a 
closed riichi hand, they would keep the 9p in their hand to use as a pair or potential ankou. If 
they had a yakuhai toitsu, that would give them even more reason to keep the 9p toitsu, as it is a 
very easy toitsu to pon. The 9p toitsu drop also tells us that their hand is most likely decently 
quick and locked into a kuitan shape; if it were slower, it would make more sense for them to fish 
for yakuhai or try to form a pinfu shape instead of trying to force kuitan.</p>

<p>This makes simocha and extremely good candidate to feed. It’s almost as if simocha was signaling to 
us through the 9p toitsu drop that we should feed them! I have no clue if this was simocha’s 
intention, but if it was, then I have nothing but the upmost respect for them as a player. Of 
course, this only works if the other players are willing to play along, but in this case I was.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/4-2.png" alt="4-2" /></p>

<p>In the actual game, I ended up dropping 6m -&gt; 4m in an attempt to feed simocha some tiles they 
could call for kuitan. While 6m passed, 4m was a kanchan neck that simocha needed to call to get 
into tenpai. I then dropped a 7p, which simocha also called to improve their wait. With two 
dora-less mentsu showing, and two dora in my hand (I had picked up 4s on a later draw), the 
chance of simocha having a mangan potential hand has all but disappeared. Kamicha decided to join 
in the fun, breaking up a 3p from one of their mentsu in an attempt to sashikomi into simocha. 
Miraculously, Simocha calls ron on the 3p, winning their 1000 point hand. 1st, 2nd and 3rd place 
have all achieved their separate goals, and all with minimal risk.</p>

<p>By leveraging both the point situation and my read of simochas hand, I was able to confirm 2nd 
place with little to no RNG invovled. I removed myself from the round (as did kamicha), and instead 
funneled my resources into making simocha’s hand as cheap and fast as possible. Simiocha  obliged, 
since they were being threatened by toimen. By working together, we were able to each achieve our 
goals, with minimal risk.</p>

<p>Remember this: anyone can play solitaire. But Mahjong is a four-player game. The crux of good 
mahjong play is to identify each other player’s best interests, and form alliances when a player’s 
interests aligns with yours. Especially in the later stages of the hanchan, you should be on the 
lookout for potential alliances. If you refuse to forge friendships, then you’ll find yourself at 
the mercy of a friend you can’t trust: luck.</p>

        <p>Originally, I had planned for this blog to be somewhat instructional, as the English mahjong 
community in general doesn’t have man resources beyond the very basic fundamentals. However, I’ve 
since realised that this isn’t quite the direction I want this blog to go. Partially because I 
don’t think I’m quite good enough to solicit advice just yet, and partly because distilling the

<p>Instead, I’m want this to be more of a stream of consciousness log, where I can reason about my

        <p>Lean is not a quick hack to increase your win-rates. In the words of Bobby Scar, who applied a 
<a href="https://leanmelee.wordpress.com/">similar-but-different Lean framework</a> (that inspired this one) 
to the game Super Smash Brothers Melee:</p>

<p><em>First, Lean is not a way to start winning a few more games quickly. It’s also not 
merely a reminder that we should continue to learn and improve. The desire to improve 
is a requirement. A commitment to the philosophy of continuously achieving validated 
learning is the foundation.</em></p>

<p>Lean Mahjong is a framework that is all about identifying and removing waste from our process. To 
do this requires a strong understanding of mahjong fundamentals and mechanisms that I plan to delve 
into in the upcoming posts. Instead of giving a detailed explanation and a bunch of definitions 
about what Lean is though, I figure the best way to explain what I hope to accomplish is with a 
simple example. For now, here’s a little taste of what I have planned.</p>

<h3 id="a-problem">A Problem</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2-1.png" alt="2-1" /></p>

<p>What is the best tile to cut here? The xia screams saftey; after all, toimen has already cut a xia, 
meaning that anyone waiting on that tile would have to have committed themselves to a tanki xia 
wait. Plus, if the xia does pass as expected, and one of the two players in riichi is unlucky 
enough to draw a haku, this gives us an instant ryanmen tenpai for a dealer mangan, which would 
essentially be a win condition given how far behind kamicha is. With all that said, surely xia is 
the best tile to cut here?</p>

<p>That’s exactly the trap that I fell in admist the chaos of this hanchan. As a result, I ended up 
playing into a baiman from kamicha (chiitoi with 2 dora 2 ura), and ended the hanchan in 4th, 
losing precious Tenhou dan points. Was this really my fault, or did I just get screwed over by the 
gods of mahjong yet again?</p>

<h3 id="assessment">Assessment</h3>

<p>Was cutting xia such a grave sin? While there are many good reasons that you should cut xia here, 
that doesn’t necessarily mean that you should. Even if it is the most EV positive tile to cut here, 
it’s also what I consider a “lazy” cut.</p>

<p>There are a few key points here. The first is the fact that kamicha is below 3900 points. If they 
play into anything bigger than a 3 han 30 fu hand, they will bust. Assuming that kamicha and 
simocha are waiting on a similar number of tiles, and that both me and toimen fold, and that one of
the ronpai is drawn by a combatant, we are left with the following three outcomes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>50% chance that either player tsumos.</li>
  <li>25% chance that kamicha plays into simocha.</li>
  <li>25% chance that simocha plays into kamicha.</li>
</ol>

<p>(Note: I’ve purposely ignored ryuukyoku since it is actually beneficial in this case. Getting off 
your dealership in South round as 1st place, without incuring any point differential from your 
rival toimen should be considered a win. The percentages are all slightly lower when you factor 
in ryuukyoku.)</p>

<p>This means that by doing absolutely nothing, my chance of flat out winning the hanchan is already 
around a solid 25%; extremely good considering that I am playing betaori. Usually when you decide 
to play betaori, you are essentially conceding a bite-sized chunk of points (tenpai payments or 
tsumo, plus the points you may have earned had you pushed) to dodge a large hit. In this case, you 
might not even have to take a small hit; kamicha busting would be to your absolute advantage!</p>

<p>Similarly, in the event that kamicha hits simocha, kamicha and simocha would now both be outside of 
striking range of first. Essentially, they would be scrapping between themselves for 3rd, and the 
battle for first would be narrowed down to a battle between me and toimen. This is especially good 
in Houou, as placing 2nd nets a fairly decent reward of +45pt.</p>

<p>The second key point is that the dora is the haku. Since I’m already holding two of them, if any of 
the two combatants is using the dora, it must either be a dora tanki or dora toitsu. The first 
thing this tells us is that at least one of the hands is likely cheap, since there are only 2 
usable dora left. The threat of paying into a large oya penalty is therefore lessened.</p>

<p>Next, let’s consider how this affects the potential hand shapes of the players in riichi. 
Discounting dora tanki (since there’s no way I’m playing the dora), let’s suppose that someone is 
holding the dora toitsu. Naturally, a menzen hand holding a toitsu of yakuhai tiles lends itself to 
a specific hand: chiitoi. If we consider the possibility of chiitoi, xia immediately becomes much 
more dangerous. Not only is it commonly considered a good chiitoi wait, if we do play in with the 
xia, it is extremely likely that we will be paying into a haneman. Even that alone is enough to 
offset the relative safety that the xia brings in terms of deal-in percentage. Chancing it risks 
too much for next to zero value.</p>

<h3 id="alternative">Alternative</h3>

<p>So, what should we discard instead? Is there a better tile to cut? In this case, even taking 
toimen’s xia discard into consideration, there is a safer tile to cut.</p>

<p><strong>8s is the safest cut in this instance.</strong></p>

<p>Kamicha has cut 8s and the tile that they declared riichi on was the 5s. This means that if simocha 
is waiting on the 8s, it would have to be kanchan, shanpon, or tanki.</p>

<p>We see two 8s tiles in the discard pile and we have one 8s in our hand, so a shanpon wait is 
physically impossible. Simocha discarded 6s two turns before the riichi, which means that they 
would’ve had to have purposely given up a 58s ryanmen for an 8s kanchan. Last but not least, if 
simocha is waiting on a 8s tanki, that means that they purposely commited to a jigoku tanki on the 
8s, knowing fully well that kamicha is likely to chase given their desperate situation. From a 
macro-game perspective, this train of thought makes next to no sense.</p>

<h3 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h3>

<p>Understanding that we made a mistake is important. But even more important is uncovering the root 
cause; that is, why did we make this mistake in the first place? To diagnose this, we have to be 
honest with ourselves and determine, from deep within our mental stack, what exactly led to us 
making this mistake. In our reflection, we need to scan for root causes, which are usually quite 
hard to surface. In my experience, working your way back through your thought process is generally 
the best way to filter for these root causes. For reference, my own inner dialgoue went a little 
like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I cut the xia and dealt into a baiman hand.
    <ul>
      <li>Why did I cut the xia?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I felt like xia was safe to push, and I wasn’t aware of any alternatives.
    <ul>
      <li>Why did I feel like xia was safe? Why wasn’t I aware of 8s?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I made a lazy play and didn’t bother considering 8s, because xia is usually safe. I also failed 
to consider that, if xia is the ronpai, it is very likely that I play into a haneman.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, the root cause of the problem was hidden in the third layer of my thought process. I 
was lazy; even though xia isn’t genbutsu, I naturally assumed it was the safest tile, given that 
the rest of my hand is filled with all number tiles and the dora. It felt even safer because I had 
a toitsu in my hand, and toimen had discarded one early, leaving tanki as the only option. Had I 
stopped to think about how dangerous (value wise) xia is from the context of this board, or noticed 
that 8s was practically a 100% safe tile, I would have never played it.</p>

<p>(As an aside, I personally believe that the “EV-positive” play is almost always also the lazy one. 
Lazy doesn’t mean that the play is necessarily bad; it just means that, for a given board state, 
there may be a better cut lingering in the shadows that we miss by tunneling on the EV-positive 
play. I often wonder if people that play different imperfect information games, like poker, carry 
similar thoughts to the ones I do regarding this matter…)</p>

<h3 id="treatment">Treatment</h3>

<p>Now that we have identified a root cause for the waste, we need to determine some sort of practical 
treatment to ensure that we never make the same mistake again. In this case, the root cause of my 
misplay was due to my laziness; I tunnel visionned on a tile that is usually safe, and discounted 
any information that might have suggested a better cut.</p>

<p>In the past, I’ve tried increasing my in-game focus level with varying results. It’s simply 
unrealistic to believe that your mind will always be in the zone, especially when playing in a 
relatively low pressure environment like Tenhou. With that in mind, my proposed treatment is a 
quick and fast rule that I can apply and eventually make a habit of. The goal is that, when faced 
with a similar situation, my mind will naturally follows this process. My proposed treatment is as 
follows:</p>

<p><em>Whenever riichi is called, immediately look for at least two tiles that are safe. Then, if 
folding, compare those options and cut the one you have concluded is safest.</em></p>

<p>While I haven’t tested this approach yet (to be honest, I just came up with it today), it seems a 
lot more promising than the usual approach of going down the tile safety tier list. With this, I am 
essentially playing a mind trick on myself. This mind trick forces me to validate the actual safety 
level of a certain tile in lieu of other potential safe tiles.</p>

<p>Obviously, this approach can backfire; the last thing you want to do is waste time stuck in 
analysis paralysis while the Tenhou clock keeps ticking down. It also uses a lot more mental energy 
than the usual “throw the safest tile”. But as this approach becomes more habitual, I am hoping 
that the benefits will provide more than enough compensation for its downsides.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>I hope this gives you a deeper insight on what the goal of this project is. Remember, a huge part 
of eliminating waste comes from treating lazy habits like this one. During the course of this 
voyage, I aim to reason about and eliminate as much waste from my mahjong process as I can, keeping 
it as lean as possible. Hopefully you have been inspired to do the same.</p>

<p><strong>See you on Tenhou.</strong></p>

        <p><strong><em>Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact.</em></strong></p>

<p>I’ve been playing competitive mahjong for about a year now, and needless to say I’ve become 
enamoured with the game. In one year, I’ve managed to rank up from a measly Tenhou 3-dan to a 
respectable (?) Tenhou 7-dan, earning the prized privilege of playing online with top players and 
professionals from Japan and the rest of the world on the Houou table. However, facing off against 
the skilled players of the Houou table has presented me with my biggest challenge yet.</p>

<p>I’ve had a constant fear throughout my short career as a competitive mahjong player; the fear of 
being unable to improve. Until now, I’ve always managed to push through any dips in my progression, 
but as a result of achieving 7-dan, it does feel as though I’ve hit a wall. While the opponents 
that I have to face off against have gotten exponentially tougher, my gameplay has remained stale 
and stagnant.</p>

<p>I began to ponder why this stagnation was occuring, and I came to the conclusion that it’s not a 
lack of talent, nor motivation. The root cause of my stagnation lies in the way that I view the 
game.</p>

<p>Mahjong is an extremely difficult game to master, in part due to how noisy the feedback loop is. 
One player may make many a mistake, and still end up 1st on the table due to variance. In the same 
vein, the “best” play may very well end up being the play that puts you in 4th. While in the past 
I’ve used aggregated stats to determine my “level”, I now believe that, even holistically over 1000 
hanchan, results-based feedback is not an option in Mahjong. Tabulating your winning percentages 
tells you a very specific thing; do you win more often, or do you lose more often? But that is very 
different from telling you <em>how</em> or <em>why</em> you win; <em>how</em> or <em>why</em> you lose. You cannot rely on 
stats to tell you why you are winning or losing.</p>

<p><strong>The only thing that you can rely on is <em>process</em>.</strong></p>

<p>Lean Mahjong is my attempt at getting to the very essence of the game of Mahjong. By trimming away 
all the noise and nonsense from the game, we can begin to understand what going on during a game of 
Mahjong at the core. Once we have achieved that understanding, we can begin to build upon that, 
reasoning about what actions cause waste, and what actions deliver value.</p>

<p>I have no clue what will come from this experiment, but I am commiting myself to the process. This 
blog will be a living record; proof of my own commitments. I hope that the information provided in 
this blog, whether effective or not, will be useful or at least insightful to any readers that may 
have stumbled upon it.</p>

<p>And with that, it’s time to begin making sense out of the madness. To wherever madness takes us.</p>

<p><strong>See you on Tenhou.</strong></p>
