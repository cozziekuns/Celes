#### *Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact.*

I've been playing competitive mahjong for about a year now, and needless to say 
I've become enamoured with the game. In one year, I've managed to rank up from
a measly Tenhou 3-dan to a respectable (?) Tenhou 7-dan, earning the prized 
privilege of playing online with top players and professionals from Japan and the
rest of the world on the Houou table. However, facing off against the skilled 
players of the Houou table has presented me with my biggest challenge yet.

I've had a constant fear throughout my short career as a competitive mahjong 
player; the fear of being unable to improve. Until now, I've always managed to 
push through any dips in my progression, but as a result of achieving 7-dan, 
it does feel as though I've hit a wall. While the opponents that I have to face
off against have gotten exponentially tougher, my gameplay has remained stale 
and stagnant.

I began to ponder why this stagnation was occuring, and I came to the conclusion
that it's not a lack of talent, or motivation. The root cause of my stagnation 
lies in the way that I view the game. 

Mahjong is an extremely difficult game to master, in part due to how noisy the
feedback loop is. One player may make many a mistake, and still end up 1st on 
the table due to variance. In the same vein, the "best" play may very well
end up being the play that puts you in 4th. While in the past I've used aggregated
stats to determine my "level", I now believe that, even hollistically over 1000 
hanchan, results-based feedback is not an option in Mahjong. The reason being that
tabulating your winning percentages tells you a very specific thing; that being 
either you win more, or you lose more. But that is very different from telling you
*how* or *why* you win; *how* or *why* you lose. You cannot rely on stats to 
tell you why you are winning or losing.

#### The only thing that you can rely on is *process*.

Lean Mahjong is my attempt at getting to the very essence of the game of Mahjong.
By trimming away all the noise and nonsense from the game, we can begin to 
understand what going on during a game of Mahjong at the core. Once we have achieved 
that understanding, we can begin to build upon that, reasoning about what actions 
cause waste, and what actions deliver value.
 
I have no clue what will come from this experiment, but I am commmiting myself to
the process. This blog will be a living record, hopefully proving my own commitments 
to myself. I hope that the information provided in this blog, whether effective or
not, will be useful or insightful to any readers who may have stumbled upon it. 

And with that, it's time to begin this fantastic adventure. Making sense out of the 
madness. To wherever madness takes us.

#### See you on Tenhou.
