Originally, I had planned for this blog to be somewhat instructional, as the English mahjong 
community in general doesn't have man resources beyond the very basic fundamentals. However, I've 
since realised that this isn't quite the direction I want this blog to go. Partially because I 
don't think I'm quite good enough to solicit advice just yet, and partly because distilling the 
ideas in my head takes more time and effort than I am willing to commit to at this time.

Instead, I'm want this to be more of a stream of consciousness log, where I can reason about my 
ideas and philosophies regarding mahjong. In other words, I'm repurposing this blog as my personal 
sounding board. Hopefully, any readers that stumble upon it will be able to gleam some 
sort of usefulness within these unfiltered scribbles.

As a sidenote, November marks the start of NaNoWriMo, or National Novel Writing Month. While I 
won't be engaging in writing a novel, I'm shooting for a goal of one weekly blogpost for this 
month. At the end of the month, I'll be gauging how viable this release schedule is.

**See you on Tenhou.**
