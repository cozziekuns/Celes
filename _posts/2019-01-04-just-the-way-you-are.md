The last two months of 2018 were pretty rough. Not only did I drop out of the Houou table after a 
massive losing streak, but I started to lose faith in my mahjong skills. More specifically, I began 
to question whether or not I would ever be able to improve my game beyond what it was currently at. 
This is, unfortunately, a common pattern for me, and combating it has been a lifelong struggle. 
Almost every skill that I've commited large amounts of time to follows the same pattern:

* Start off terrible, worse than everyone else (even other beginners).
* Spend inordinate amounts of time grinding in order to become decent.
* Reach some sort of intermediate level that is "above-average," but nowhere near close to the top 
    echelon.
* Plateau in terms of skill.
* Fall into a slump. ( ‚Üê You are here )
* Quit after finding a new hobby.

And I've been stuck in a two-month long slump that continues to haunt me from the shadows. 
Initially, I had a lot of success playing in Tokujou, and felt that I could easily return to Houou. 
However, as everyone knows, mahjong is not such an easy game. Thanks to some bad play, I've 
essentially ended up back to square one after 100+ games. 

Almost every other time this has occured in my life, it has ended with me quitting, mostly due to a 
general lack of interest, or because something new and shiny shows up. This time, I'm committed to 
perservering and continuing to play the game. The game is so deep, so unexplored, and there is 
so much more room for improvement. So, I'll trudge on.

It's 2019 and times are a changing. The format of this blog will be changing a little as well.
Thoughts that appear in my head often appear in a jumbled and abstract state that requires immense 
mental energy to transform into something that others can understand. In order to remove some of 
the friction that comes from writing these blogposts, I'll be presenting my unfiltered opinions and 
judgements on the game instead of trying to distill useful information and writing about that 
information. The quality of my posts will almost surely worsen as a result, but I am a selfish and 
lazy individual by nature, and this is the only way to push me into creating any sort of content, 
useful or not.

This blog was originally created as an avenue to vent my thoughts on the game, and in classic lean 
fashion, any process that hinders that main goal will discarded. Hopefully y'all can still reap 
something useful from it.

**See you on Tenhou.**
