title: How Dora Influences Yaku
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

In order to fulfill his insatiable curiosity, the author embarks on a journey to determine the 
correlation between dora and the yaku of the winning hand. He ends up parsing and analysing roughly 
2000 Houou games, or ~10000 hands, to help answer one of mahjong's biggest questions: just how much 
does the dora influence how we play the game?

I dislike most statistical analyses because the stats themselves aren't that important, and are 
oftentimes incredibly misleading. Mahjong is a complex equation of conditional probabilities 
involving everything from the discard pile to the personalities of the players that are sitting at 
your table, and the random sampling of hands that is most statistical analysis hardly does this 
equation justice. However, I do think statistics are useful for buildling an intuition for the 
game, or affirming prexisting hunches, and also for general discussion. Therefore, I will be 
accompanying each stat with my intuition for what the stat illustrates. I encourage the reader to 
form their own opinions; healthy discussion around stats is what makes them useful!

Not included in these stats are extremely rare hands / yakuman, and "luck" yaku (ippatsu, uradora, 
haitei/houtei, etc). The rare hands / yakuman occur so infrequently that, from a competitive 
standpoint, I don't think there is any reason to investigate them. In general, any correlation 
between dora and these luck yaku would not be strong enough to be practically useful; thus, they 
are omitted.

The format of the stats is as follows:

* **Yaku / Dora**:
  * Dora Tile "Type": Percentage of Agari that include this Yaku.

For example, if there are only three hands analysed: riichi pinfu (ton dora), riichi tsumo (pei 
dora), and tanyao (6p dora), the stats would look like this:

* **Riichi**:
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 0%
  * Kazepai: 100%
<p></p>
* **Tsumo**:
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 0%
  * Kazepai: 50%
<p></p>
* **Pinfu**:
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 0%
  * Kazepai: 50%
<p></p>
* **Tanyao**:
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 100%
  * Kazepai: 0%

Let's get into it.

* **Dora**:
  * Routouhai: 27.955%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 51.921%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 41.409%
  * Sangenpai: 15.165%
  * Kazepai: 16.030%

When the dora is a jihai, only ~15% of the hands that win the round incorporate it in their hand.
Jihai can only be used in toitsu and kotsu, and good players will shibori dora (esp. sangenpai in 
this case) to prevent you from using it. Routouhai are a little less hard to use, as they can be 
used in mentsu, but they can only be used in one mentsu shape (123 or 789 respectively). Still, 
it's a little surprising to see that ~28% of winning hands in a round when routouhai are dora will 
try to use it in their hand (roughly 1.5x vs. jihai). I guess being able to use it in a mentsu 
shape is just that big. 

The takeaway from this is that that controlling the aka-dora in situations where the dora is either 
jihai or routouhai is incredibly important. Pushing into hands becomes a lot easier, since the 
chance that the hand you're pushing into is actually using the dora is, on average, pretty low. Of 
course, some care must be taken, because if the dora is a part of the hand, then the hand will be 
at least 3 han (dora toitsu + X). That's where your analog/occult reading skills should come into 
play.

* **Aka-dora**:
  * Routouhai: 42.169%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 42.929%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 43.655%
  * Sangenpai: 44.670%
  * Kazepai: 44.082%

A tenhou players best friend. As expected, aka-dora scores the highest for overall "yaku" usage. 
Aka-dora usage is a little higher when the regular dora is a sangenpai or kazepai. As stated above, 
because both sangenpai and kazepai are harder to use, hands featuring aka-dora as their main method 
of value boosting become slightly more common.

* **Riichi**:
  * Routouhai: 41.430%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 38.007%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 39.010%
  * Sangenpai: 41.053%
  * Kazepai: 40.261%
<p></p>
* **Tsumo**:
  * Routouhai: 24.084%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 23.373%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 23.103%
  * Sangenpai: 25.761%
  * Kazepai: 25.396%
<p></p>
* **Pinfu**:
  * Routouhai: 20.420%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 19.784%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 19.611%
  * Sangenpai: 20.939%
  * Kazepai: 21.249%
<p></p>
* **Ippeikou**:
  * Routouhai: 3.753%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 3.697%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 3.643%
  * Sangenpai: 4.188%
  * Kazepai: 4.101%
<p></p>
* **Sanshoku Doujun**:
  * Routouhai: 3.901%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 3.217%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 3.582%
  * Sangenpai: 3.236%
  * Kazepai: 4.613%

Menzen hands are king when sangenpai and kazepai are the dora, and the variance in tsumo-rate shows
this pretty well. When middle suuhai are the dora, kuitan becomes a lot more powerful, and as a
result more players will go open to reap their 3900/7700 hands. Even yakuhai + dora + aka is a
combination that provides speed and ample value. When sangenpai and kazepai are the dora, going
open without any regular dora will only result in a 1000 or 2000 with a "normal" hand, so menzen
is required if looking for value. General rule of thumb is that the harder the dora is the use, the
more we should expect a menzen hand to have some sort of value adding yaku.

* **Ikkitsuukan**:
  * Routouhai: 1.418%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 1.453%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 1.488%
  * Sangenpai: 0.952%
  * Kazepai: 1.258%

The exception to the rule. Ikki is a lot more common when suuhai are dora, and my gut feeling tells
me that this is because holding onto a shape like 123568p is a lot more enticing when the 8p is
dora for instance. So, Ikki naturally progresses from these shapes with floating suuhai dora tiles.

* **Tanyao**:
  * Routouhai: 21.070%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 23.361%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 23.254%
  * Sangenpai: 24.429%
  * Kazepai: 23.532%

What many tenhou players consider to be a "broken" yaku. Surprisingly, Routouhai dora aside, Tanyao
has a pretty even spread throughout all the other types of dora. My intuition tells me that this is
because sangenpai and kazepai are so hard to use that tanyao becomes the value add yaku for
closed hands. Also, kuitan is actually faster when sangenpai are the dora, because the speed of 
sangenpai hands decreases, as jihai are more likely to be shibori when the dora is a sangenpai.

* **Yakuhai (Bakaze)**:
  * Routouhai: 7.565%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 8.403%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 7.407%
  * Sangenpai: 5.838%
  * Kazepai: 8.947%
<p></p>
* **Yakuhai (Jikaze)**:
  * Routouhai: 8.983%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 8.223%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 8.956%
  * Sangenpai: 7.868%
  * Kazepai: 8.434%
<p></p>
* **Yakuhai (Sangenpai)**:
  * Routouhai: 22.606%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 24.082%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 22.556%
  * Sangenpai: 23.096%
  * Kazepai: 18.360%

Somewhat interesting results. Nothing to say about this one except that further detailed analysis 
that specifically pinpoints which yakuhai are being called (dora yakuhai vs. non-dora yakuhai) is 
probably necessary before we can create an intuition about this one.

* **Honitsu**:
  * Routouhai: 4.433%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 4.382%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 4.463%
  * Sangenpai: 3.807%
  * Kazepai: 4.054%

Stat that illustrates a common theme: jihai are a lot harder to call when they're the dora
(esp. sangenpai). Conversely, going for honiitsu of a dora suit is a nice and easy way to secure a
mangan class hand (honiitsu + yakuhai + dora).

* **Chinitsu**:
  * Routouhai: 0.591%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 0.468%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 0.486%
  * Sangenpai: 0.825%
  * Kazepai: 0.606%

A little bit of a surprising statistic, but we can try to make sense of it. Chinitsu isn't required
to generate large hands when you already have easy to use dora powering your hand. Furthermore, 
giving up something like a 56p ryanmen when the rest of your hand is souzu is a lot harder when 6p 
is the dora and 5p is an aka.

* **Chanta**:
  * Routouhai: 0.916%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 0.816%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 0.971%
  * Sangenpai: 0.761%
  * Kazepai: 0.979%
<p></p>
* **Junchan**:
  * Routouhai: 0.296%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 0.264%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 0.273%
  * Sangenpai: 0.254%
  * Kazepai: 0.466%

I figured that chanta and junchan would be a lot more likely when routouhai were the dora, but
surprisingly this isn't quite the case. Kazepai wins in both scenarios because the hard to use dora
makes going for these value yaku hands a lot more enticing. Sangenpai as dora is both hard to call
and provides enough value if it is called that going for chanta isn't necessary once you've secured
your yakuhai pon.

* **Chiitoi**:
  * Routouhai: 3.073%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 2.593%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 3.005%
  * Sangenpai: 3.299%
  * Kazepai: 3.635%

Suuhai tend towards building mentsu, so chiitoi isn't as effective when suuhai are dora.
Conversely, jihai can only be used as toitsu or ankou, so be on the lookout for chiitoi when the
dora is a jihai.

* **Sanankou**:
  * Routouhai: 0.680%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 0.540%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 0.729%
  * Sangenpai: 0.888%
  * Kazepai: 0.559%
<p></p>
* **Toitoi**:
  * Routouhai: 1.832%
  * 3-7 Chunchanpai: 1.513%
  * 2-8 Chunchanpai: 1.913%
  * Sangenpai: 1.777%
  * Kazepai: 1.771%

Somewhat surprising even spread across all dora types, with the obvious exception being the
mentsu based 3-7 suuhai dora, as those tiles are much more prone to being used in mentsu. I suppose 
connecting a pair of 2-8 chunchanpai to two distinct mentsu is a lot harder than connecting a pair 
of 3-7 chunchanpai.

And that's that! It's pretty amazing to see just how much the dora can shape the progression and 
speed of hands. For example, the interaction: jihai dora → yakuhai are shibori → yakuhai hands 
are slower → kuitan hands are "faster" as a result. This is an interactions that is non-obvious, 
and it's interesting to see these interactions reflected in the stats.

**See you on Tenhou.**
