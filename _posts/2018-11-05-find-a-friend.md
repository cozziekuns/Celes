**_Anyone can play solitaire._**

A friend of mine once posited that they could make a strong mahjong bot simply by running a 
machine-learning model tuned towards maximising agari-rate. This is akin to saying that a strong 
chess bot can be made by tuning for capturing material. Fortunately for us humans, mahjong, like 
chess, is not such a simple game. Mahjong is not just about winning hands, just as chess is not 
just about winning material. After all, anyone can play solitaire. What mahjong really is about is 
_winning games_. 

So how can we optimise for winning games? Like in life, trying to go it alone is a bad idea; the 
best way to win is often to _find a friend_.

What should we discard here? Currently, we're in ORAS with a decently comfortable lead over 3rd 
and 4th place. Since a mangan direct from either 3rd or 4th would lead us in 3rd place, the 
standard line would be to aim for 1st place. Unfortunately for us, 1st place is more than 
a haneman tsumo away from us; in order to even think about taking 1st place, we'd need to form what 
is at least a haneman class hand. We do have a nice aka-dora and the dora 4s can connect to an 
aka 5s, so a haneman isn't that unrealistic... But even after all that, we would have to flip some 
ura dora on the tsumo for the baiman, or pray that 1st place plays into us. Not happening. 

Aiming for 1st place here is not only unrealistic, it puts us in danager of falling into 3rd. While 
we do have a comfortable lead over 3rd and 4th, that lead is rather fickle; a mangan tsumo from 
either player will put us into 3rd, and we would end up losing a precious +45 dan points that 
should've been all but secured. Worse, if we flying too close to the sky and riiching, we 
might end up with some burnt wings if we play into a mangan from 4th place; now we've just ended up 
in last place from the riichi stick payment.

So the goal of this hand should be to secure 2nd place. There are actually a few ways we can 
accomplish this. The first, and most straightforward method, would be to of course win a hand. 
While two turns in it does look like our hand is pretty fast, this is one of those hands where 
it'll be hard to secure a yaku that isn't riichi. Pinfu is probably the closest candidate, to a 
yaku that we can use, but it's just as likely that we'll end up completing our ryanmen before our 
bad waits, and be stuck with a hand we need to riichi in order to win. Given that this is an ORAS 
situation where the speed of our hand is all that matters, we would really like to be able to call; 
something that we obviously can't do with pinfu as our yaku.

We have the choice to rely on our kamicha. It goes without saying, but if kamicha wins any hand, 
the game will end and we'll end up in second. Unfortunately, this isn't the most reliable strategy 
either. Not only is kamicha in a situation where they're incentivised to fold (as they are last oya 
with an obscene lead), even if they did have a quick hand, the only way we could assist them would 
be by blocking off our simocha from calling. This leaves us at the mercy of toimen; if toimen 
riichis and tsumos a mangan, bye-bye 2nd place.

Which brings us to my favourite method; feed simocha! We can leverage the fact that simocha must 
favour speed over value given the amount of duress he is under from toimen. Not only is toimen 
within 2000 points of simocha, his first and second discards (8m -> hatsu tedashi) signal a quicker 
than usual hand. Furthermore, since this is aka-ari mahjong, toimen's condition of escaping 3rd 
(2000 points) is essentially a given, with how easy it is to use the 4s dora, and the existence of 
aka-dora. If we are able to convince simocha to start calling, we can reduce the average/maxmimum 
value of their hand and thereby reduce the chance that we'll fall into 3rd place via a mangan 
tsumo.

Due to how irregular simocha's discards are, and the board situation, we can deduce a myriad of 
conclusions about their hand. Simocha's first and second drop were both a 9p from inside of their 
hand; in other words, they explicitly dropped a toitsu of routouhai from the very start. From this, 
we can conclude that are almost surely going for a tanyao hand. If they were going for a closed 
riichi hand, they would keep the 9p in their hand to use as a pair or potential ankou. If they had 
a yakuhai toitsu, that would give them even more reason to keep the 9p toitsu, as it is a very easy 
toitsu to pon. The 9p toitsu drop also tells us that their hand is most likely decently quick and 
locked into a kuitan shape; if it were slower, it would make more sense to fish for yakuhai or try 
to form a pinfu shape instead of trying to force kuitan.

This makes simocha and extremely good candidate to feed. It's almost as if simocha was signaling to 
us through the 9p toitsu drop that we should feed them! I have no clue if this was simocha's 
intention, but if it was, then I have nothing but the upmost respect for them as a player. Of 
course, this only works if the other players are willing to play along, but in this case I was.

In the actual game, I ended up dropping 6m -> 4m in an attempt to feed simocha some tiles they 
could call for kuitan. While 6m passed, 4m was a kanchan neck that simocha needed to call to get 
into tenpai. I then dropped a 7p, which simocha also called to improve their wait. With two 
dora-less mentsu showing, and two dora in my hand (I had picked up 4s on a later draw), the 
chance of simocha having a mangan potential hand has all but disappeared. Kamicha decided to join 
in the fun, breaking up a 3p from one of their mentsu in an attempt to sashikomi into simocha. 
Miraculously, Simocha calls ron on the 3p, winning their 1000 point hand. 1st, 2nd and 3rd place 
have all achieved their separate goals, and all with minimal risk.

By leveraging both the point situation and my read of simochas hand, I was able to confirm 2nd 
place with little to no RNG invovled. I removed myself from the round (as did kamicha), and instead 
funneled my resources into making simocha's hand as cheap and fast as possible. Simiocha  obliged, 
since they were being threatened by toimen. By working together, we were able to each achieve our 
goals, with minimal risk.

Remember this: anyone can play solitaire. But Mahjong is a four-player game. The crux of good 
mahjong play is to identify each other player's best interests, and form alliances when a player's 
interests aligns with yours. Especially in the later stages of the hanchan, you should be looking 
to find a friend. If you refuse to forge friendships, then you'll find yourself at the mercy of a 
friend you can't trust: luck.

**See you on Tenhou.**
